# Redux Counter
This a a simple counter application to practice redux.
1. **Increment and Decrement:** Every click on the "Increase" button raises the count by one, while the "Decrease" button lowers it by one.
2. **Milestone Indicator:** A green dot appears on every fifth milestone (e.g., 5, 10, 15, etc.), indicating significant points in the count. The dots are displayed dynamically and accumulate with each milestone.
